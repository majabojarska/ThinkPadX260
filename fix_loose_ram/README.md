# Fix loose RAM module

The X250-X270 notebooks have a design flaw that sometimes causes the device to crash, when lifted by a corner/edge. This is likely caused by the memory (RAM) module losing contact with the SODIMM socket, due to chassis strain. 

A simple fix that mitigates this issue is to stick rubber standoffs under the RAM module. This reduces the possible range of motion for the RAM module, reducing the probability of losing contact with the SODIMM socket.

See the [PDF](loose_ram_fix.pdf) for details.
